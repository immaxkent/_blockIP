# Aims of the Contracts File

Here exists a set of contracts that allow functionality of our app. 

1. Deployment.sol
...whereby the owner of the contract can deploy the contract to the blockchain, and is recorded as the sole controller of the application therein.

2. BlockIPFactory.sol
...wherein the owner is capable of issuing an NFT to a given user, attaching the otherwise generated CID (used as the item's URI) to the NFT's metadata.
