# Blockchain Intellectual Property

This is an open source project enabling any authoritarian body to issue IP, from patents through trademarks, via the blockchain.

Specifically, this project allows you as the issuer to create NFT style 'receipts', upload client documentation indellably onto the IPFS filing system, and create indellable attestations recording indefinitely the issuance of the IP to a given user's Ethereum wallet. 

Via this application's interface, you are able to elect the chain of custody for the IP post evaluation of the IP's validity.

We'll walk you through an example a bit later, but for now, let's get it all up and running...

## How To

```bash
npm install
```
